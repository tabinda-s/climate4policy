Millions of coastal communityâ€™s residents will face the disruptive high-tide flood, the flood cause by sea level rise will soon expand to farther inland. The comparison diagrams indicate the number of properties are at risk by the rise of sea level rise throughout the U.S from 2018 to 2100. By 2100, the number of at risk home will expands to more than 1 million. on the other hand,  these results did not include future development such as homes, nor urban infrastructures in our projection. While comparing to California, the number of properties at risk does not present as a extrem growth as Florida.

Urban density consider as the key factor which has strong impact the increase rate of damage cause by sea level rise. On the east coast of US, houses and public infrastructures were developed close to the coastlines whereas on the west coast, many of the cities are decentralized, therefore are more resilient to the potential risks. For the further development, it is a task for planners to think about how to deal with the sea level rise issues while keeping the adjacency to the pleasant coastal location. 

Looking into California, appropriately conservative projection to estimating risk from coastal properties financial losses and population at risk through 2030 to 2100. 10 most risky communities that are facing different level of financial losses and population who owns properties facing flooding issue. There is an exponential growth from both financial and population perspectives on San Mateo. However, as Central coast got a exponential growth on financial lost but linear growth on population, it is necessary for us to realize the crucial determinants of what factor lead to those different growth, and response to the coastal life.





Sealevel data:
The datasets are from Underwater: Rising Seas, Chronic Floods, and the Implications for US Coastal Real Estate (2018)
(https://www.ucsusa.org/global-warming/global-warming-impacts/sea-level-rise-chronic-floods-and-us-coastal-real-estate-implications#.XD6PVs9Kh0t ) There are 3 different sets are: states, community, and zp-code. For the first set graphic, I used D3 scripts from vida.io and used states datasets transferred to JSON file. For the  second set graphic, I used datawrapper to transform zip-code data into CSV file. For the third set graphic, I used datawrapper to transform community data into CSV file.
