        <h1>Climate Change Indicators</h1>
        <h2> <i> Shifts in Climate Indicators Show How the State has been Affected by Climate change</i> </h2>
        <p class="lead">California is getting warmer overall. While we only have a snapshot of data, we can still easily observe the gradual change. Normalizing this by county, we observe a mean change of 1.16 degrees F for the time period. This effect is statistically significant at the 10% level.</p>
        <img class="climate_images" src="./final_analysis/graphics/reg_meantemp.png" alt="Average temperature change in California across time period">
        <p>However, this overall trend hides substantial heterogeneity as some counties and some months have seen larger changes than others. </p>

        
        <iframe id="datawrapper-chart-5q41o" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5q41o/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important;" height="400"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">if("undefined"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper["5q41o"]={},window.datawrapper["5q41o"].iframe=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-5q41o"),window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if("undefined"!=typeof a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var b in a.data["datawrapper-height"])if("5q41o"==b)window.datawrapper["5q41o"].iframe.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][b]+"px"});</script>

        <p> This interactive map shows how some counties, like Inyo have seen over 4 degree average temperature changes in this time period, other counties like Sonoma have seen a small decrease in average temperature. </p>

        <h2> Showing Mean and Max Monthly Temperature Changes a Different Way... </h2>

        <iframe id="datawrapper-chart-Uqt2r" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Uqt2r/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; background-color: white; min-width: 100% !important;" height="1444"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">if("undefined"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper["Uqt2r"]={},window.datawrapper["Uqt2r"].iframe=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-Uqt2r"),window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if("undefined"!=typeof a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var b in a.data["datawrapper-height"])if("Uqt2r"==b)window.datawrapper["Uqt2r"].iframe.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][b]+"px"});</script>


        <div> </div>
        <p> This visual shows even more clearly how different counties have experience different levels of temperature changes. Climate change research indicates that extreme temperatures (very hot days) will become more common as well as the mean temperature increasing. This graphic shows that the hottest day per month for different counties also got hotter on average across the time period, but this shift was not in perfect lockstep with the shift in the mean temperature. Other visuals can help us make sense of this finding. </p>

        <h2> Precipitation </h2>
        <img class="climate_images" src="./final_analysis/output/ca_precip.png" alt="Average change to mean temperature per month per county in California">
        <p> While California got drier during the time period, this trend is less noticable than the change in heat (though almost universal across counties). However, one can see that places like Los Angeles county, which receives very little rainfall (get yearly average for the county) </p>

        <p> Climate change does not inherently led to drier climates, but hotter temperatures means more evaporation and that the air can store more water vapor before it must release the water in precipitation events. These means that storms are often more intense when they happen. In addition, the change to the climate has interacted with other climate phenomena in a way that has exacerbated drought in some prone areas. For example, California has suffered recent droughts that have been linked to climate change (cite). </p>

        <h2>Average Max Temperature Change</h2>
        <h3>[The max temp...]</h3>
        <img class="climate_images" src="./final_analysis/output/ca_maxtemp.png" alt="Greenhouse gas emissions vs GDP per capita in California">
        <div> </div>

        <p> The extreme heat map perhaps best exposed the substantial heterogeneity across California. Inland and southern counties experienced much hotter maximum monthly temperatures, while some counties around the bay area actually saw their hottest temperatures decrease. Following the Mark Twain quote “The coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco”, one reason for this surprising trend could be due to fog. The Bay Area receives a lot of fog during high temperatures which is a natural safeguard against high temperatures. Purely speculatively, one could imagine that with a warmer ocean and more extreme heat, that this area is seeing the cooling mechanism of fog get set off more often on would be max heat days. </p>

        <p> However, San Francisco, where we have seen slight cooling of max temperatures, has still warmed a little on average and is not one of the counties that ever had max temperatures in the summer that put its citizens at risk. To understand the impact of the change to max temperature it is worth exploring a case study. </p>

        <img class="climate_images" src="./final_analysis/graphics/inyo_july.png" alt="Inyo max temp change for all months">

        <p> In July, for instance, the max temperature which hovered around 90 degrees now regularly sits closer to 95 degrees. Already, 95 degree temperatures could pose problems for less healthy individuals, but a medium size change could have even more severe an effect in a place like San Bernadino </p>

        <img class="climate_images" src="./final_analysis/graphics/sb_july.png" alt="Inyo max temp change for all months">

        <p> With July temperatures that could already get into the mid-100s, an increase of a few degrees has meant that San Bernadino now faces max temperatures in the 110s - a daunting climate for those who have health problems and may not have access to air conditioning  </p>

        <h1>Hazards: Wildfire</h1>
        
        <p>Climate change can increase wildfire risk in California through its effects on moisture availability, temperature, vector prevalence, and lightning. Several academic papers have linked climate effects by showing that climate change has increased drought in California, led to more pine beetle infestations and tree mortality, and augmented the flammability of vegetation that fuels wildfires. As a result, modelling efforts predict that wildfires will become more frequent and larger throughout the century.

        In addition, separate research has shown lightning strikes in the western United States are will become more frequent in an altered climate, which bodes poorly for California where wildfires are most often ignited by storms. With higher temperatures, fires are expected to rage hotter and lay scourge to more area. For these reasons, normally-cautious scientists have begun to draw a causal link between climate change and forest fire. With large fires in the state over the past few years, the media has joined the frenzy, proclaiming that California is burning and climate change is the cause.

        Above, we showed that California has gotten dryer and hotter especially in the areas of the Mountains where many of the state’s forests lie. Below we have taken a separate data source to show how those changes have corresponded to fire trends.

        Acres burned and structures damaged due to wildfires have witnessed a sharp increase. A look at the data from 1990 - 2018 shows that in 1991 2,900 acres were burned while that number rose to 479, 936 in the last year. Similarly, Similarly, in 2018 nearly 22,000 structures were damaged compared to 636 structures in 1992.

        Wildfires cost the state of California an upward of 3 billion dollars in the year 2015 - a figure that has likely increased in 2018 after the deadly fires in Paradise and Malibu. In 1990, wildfires in California cost $95,707,749 and while it can be argued that inflation over time make the figure in billions look much more intimidating than is true, it is still quite a hefty sum to be dealing with -- one that California’s residents pay for. California’s population of 39 million people contributes about 76 dollars per person to fight wildfires.</p>
