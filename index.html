          <h1>Climate Change in California</h1>
          <p>Climate change has become somewhat of a taboo subject in America and yet continues to progress while we are at a political standstill. Last year, America’s carbon dioxide emissions <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/climate/greenhouse-gas-emissions-increase.html" target="_blank">rose by 3.4%</a> in the second largest gain since 1996. Many scientists worry that we are on track for irreversible <a href= “https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/09/tipping-points-could-exacerbate-climate-crisis-scientists-fear” target="_blank"> tipping points </a> if we do not abate emissions quickly.</p>
          <p>We have chosen to show, through the case of California, that it is in the best interest of the country to make major investments in climate change mitigation and adaptation and by doing so, we need not undermine the economy. Property damages from fires and sea level rises as well as public health risks from extreme temperatures make climate change too costly to ignore even if we do not consider global costs. We will first show how California has changed over the recent years and then discuss climate-induced hazards and projected costs. </p>

        <p> This visual shows even more clearly how different counties have experience different levels of temperature changes. Climate change research indicates that extreme temperatures (very hot days) will become more common as well as the mean temperature increasing. This graphic shows that the hottest day per month for different counties also got hotter on average across the time period, but this shift was not in perfect lockstep with the shift in the mean temperature. Other visuals can help us make sense of this finding. </p>

        <p> While California got drier during the time period, this trend is less noticable than the change in heat (though almost universal across counties). However, one can see that places like Los Angeles county, which receives very little rainfall.  </p>

        <p> Climate change does not inherently led to drier climates, but hotter temperatures means more evaporation and that the air can store more water vapor before it must release the water in precipitation events. These means that storms are often more intense when they happen. In addition, the change to the climate has interacted with other climate phenomena in a way that has exacerbated drought in some prone areas. For example, California has suffered recent droughts that have been linked to climate change. </p>


        <p class="lead">Average Max Temperature Change</p>
        

        <p> The extreme heat map perhaps best exposed the substantial heterogeneity across California. Inland and southern counties experienced much hotter maximum monthly temperatures, while some counties around the bay area actually saw their hottest temperatures decrease. Following the Mark Twain quote “The coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco”, one reason for this surprising trend could be due to fog. The Bay Area receives a lot of fog during high temperatures which is a natural safeguard against high temperatures. Purely speculatively, one could imagine that with a warmer ocean and more extreme heat, that this area is seeing the cooling mechanism of fog get set off more often on would be max heat days. </p>

        <p> However, San Francisco, where we have seen slight cooling of max temperatures, has still warmed a little on average and is not one of the counties that ever had max temperatures in the summer that put its citizens at risk. To understand the impact of the change to max temperature it is worth exploring a case study. </p>

        <p> In July, for instance, the max temperature which hovered around 90 degrees now regularly sits closer to 95 degrees. Already, 95 degree temperatures could pose problems for less healthy individuals, but a medium size change could have even more severe an effect in a place like San Bernadino </p>

        <p> With July temperatures that could already get into the mid-100s, an increase of a few degrees has meant that San Bernadino now faces max temperatures in the 110s - a daunting climate for those who have health problems and may not have access to air conditioning  </p>

        <p>Climate change can increase wildfire risk in California through its effects on moisture availability, temperature, vector prevalence, and lightning. According to research, climate change has increased drought in California, led to more pine beetle infestations and tree mortality, and augmented the flammability of vegetation that fuels wildfires. As a result, modelling efforts predict that wildfires will become more frequent and larger over time. With higher temperatures, fires are expected to rage hotter. </p>

        <p>Above, we showed that California has gotten drier and hotter especially in the mountainous areas where many of the state’s forests lie. Below we have taken a separate data source to show how those changes have corresponded to fire trends. </p>

        <p class="lead">Top Counties Impacted by Fires</p>

        <p> Acres burned and structures damaged due to wildfires have witnessed a sharp increase in recent years. A look at the data from 1990 - 2018 shows that 2,900 acres were burned due to fires in 1991 while that number rose to 479,936 in the last year. Similarly, 2018 say nearly 22,000 structures damaged compared to 636 structures in 1992. The dashboard below shows top counties in California that are among the worst impacted by fires along with the acres burned and structures destroyed.

        <p class="lead"> The Cost of Wildfires in California </p>

        <p> Wildfires cost the state of California an upward of 3 billion dollars in the year 2015 - a figure that has likely increased in 2018 after the deadly fires in Paradise and Malibu. In 1990, wildfires in California cost $95,707,749 and while it can be argued that inflation over time make the figure in billions look much more intimidating than is true, it is still quite a hefty sum to be dealing with -- one that California’s residents pay for. California’s population of 39 million people contributes about 76 dollars per person to fight wildfires. The following visual shows the collective damage caused by fires every year from 1990 - 2016. </p>

        <p>Sea level rise is one of the hazards associated with climate change. Countless coastal residents, properties and economies face imminent challenges. High-tide floods are becoming more frequent as chronic flooding continues to jeopardize hundreds of U.S. coastal communities. Given these mounting hazards, as coastal urban areas continue to develop it is essential to consider how to avoid losses of homes, business, and public infrastructure. </p>

        <p>Millions of coastal residents will face disruptive high-tide floods, which will expand further inland as sea levels rise. The comparison diagrams indicate the number of properties at risk from sea level rise throughout the U.S from 2018 to 2100. By 2100, the number of at risk homes will expand to more than 1 million. However these losses may be conservative, as the data did not include future development of homes or urban infrastructure in these areas. While California has significant coastal vulnerability, it pales in comparison to Florida. Development patterns can help explain this difference and guide adaptation for the future.</p>

        <p>Urban density is one of the key factors that impacts the amount of damage caused by sea level rise. On the East coast of US, dense housing and public infrastructure were developed close to the coastlines. On the West coast, many cities are decentralized and further from coastlines and are therefore are more resilient to the potential risks. As planners consider further development, they must consider how to deal with sea level rise while maintaining adjacency to desirable coastal locations. </p>

        <p> In California, conservative projections to estimating risk from coastal properties financial losses and population at risk through 2030 to 2100. 10 most risky communities that are facing different level of financial losses and population who owns properties facing flooding issue. There is an exponential growth from both financial and population perspectives on San Mateo. However, as Central coast got a exponential growth on financial lost but linear growth on population, it is necessary for us to realize the crucial determinants of what factor lead to those different growth, and response to the coastal life.</p>

        <p>The state of California has begun taking steps to address these challenges through more aggressive regulation and policies that promote investment in mitigation and adaptation. Skeptics argue that this environment is unduly burdensome for businesses and taxpayers who must compete with areas with looser regulations. Historical patterns of development have shown a direct relationship between economic growth and greenhouse gas emissions -- as economic output grows, greenhouse gas emissions grow in tandem. However, this relationship is not set in stone.</p>

        <p class="lead">Recent trends show increasing emissions are not requisite for driving growth.</p>

        <p>The data show that many states have successfully decoupled economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions. As GDP per capita increases, carbon dioxide emissions flatten or even decrease. This is true even in more heavily regulated states like California, showing that growth and regulation are not diametrically opposed.</p>

        <p class="lead">Adaptation and mitigation for the future can successfully coexist with growth in the present. Proactively combatting the effects of climate change is the smart thing to do -- both today and tomorrow.</p>
